# Lab Statistics ðŸ“ŠðŸ“ˆ
This is a set of algorithms for data analysis written mostly in Python, but also including R and C. The purpose of this compendium is to provide the GitHub scientific community, be they physicists, chemists, engineers, etc., code that can facilitate their work in laboratories and even simple investigations.
Little by little the volume of the content of this repository will be increased, starting with pure regression and distributions for data measured or obtained in a laboratory.

**NOTE**: It is planned to add deep learning algorithms and ANN or RNN, as well as code for deep symbolic regression for physics research.
